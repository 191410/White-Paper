# Possible Topic 1
1. One of the possible topics I am considering is conducting research on the best way to monitor herd populations of White-Tailed deer. I will discuss several common methods that researchers use to analyze deer herd densities in a given region and discuss which methods are  the easiest for the average person or landowner to use. These sources listed below provide different surveying methods and successs rates of various methodologies. All of the sources are peer reviewed and are provide factual information regarding how to survey undulates such as White-tail deer.
